# Synonyms: lets short/partial queries resolve to their long forms (and vice
# versa) so e.g. `stable` is treated as an exact-form match for `stablecoins`
# during the `exactness` ranking stage. Without this, an array-valued
# `keywords` attribute only produces `matchesStart` (~0.67) instead of
# `exactMatch` (1.0), so high-`r` metric pages lose to lower-`r` entities that
# happen to have an exact single-word name match.
